Description
###########

  **DO** *[[LABEL|LABEL^ROUTINENAME], ...]*

Calls a subroutine.

DO can be called with or without arguments.

Without arguments, DO will execute the code on the following line
as long as the code is at the beginning of a block with an indent
greater than that of itself. DO will continue to execute code until
it reaches a line with an insufficient indentation. It is possible
to prematurely terminate the command by executing QUIT or BREAK.

With arguments, DO will jump to the specified label or routine
and execute from there until a QUIT is found. When encountered,
the program will continue executing commands after the DO.

Parameters
###########

**LABEL**
 (string) The label to jump to

**LABEL^ROUTINENAME**
 (string) The label and routine name to jump to
